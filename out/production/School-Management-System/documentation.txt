 Bottle neck 1
    How to store the names of multiple teachers or students.
        Poor methods:
            Creating an object manually for each new student or teacher --> Consider an entry of 500students, this
                will be very tasking.
            Use of an array --> what if we do not know how  many students/teachers will be coming in advance?
        Best Method:
            Using an array list
